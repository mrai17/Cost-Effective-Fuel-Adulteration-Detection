Petroleum Purity Tester
Petroleum Purity Tester is a Flutter app that connects to a portable microcontroller-based refractometer device for detecting adulterated/impure petroleum products by measuring the dielectric constant value of the liquids. The app allows households to make real-time decisions and avoid home accidents caused by impure fuel.

Features
Connect to the portable microcontroller-based refractometer device via Bluetooth
Display the measured fuel quality data (dielectric constant value)
Alert the user if the fuel is adulterated or impure
Support for Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), Automotive Gas oil (AGO) or diesel, and House-Hold Kerosene (HHK)
Real-time updates of the fuel quality data on the app UI
Getting Started
To get started with the app, you need to:

Clone this repository to your local machine
Open the project in Android Studio or Visual Studio Code
Connect your Android or iOS device to your computer
Run the app on your device
Note: You may need to enable Bluetooth on your device and pair it with the portable microcontroller-based refractometer device before using the app.
